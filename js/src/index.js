/**
 * The shared viewer policy, as one entry point.
 *
 * Everything here is host-neutral. All of it but `page.js` takes a
 * three-cad-viewer instance and plain data and touches no DOM, no transport
 * and no host; `page.js` is the page, so it does. What stays with a host is
 * how it starts - where it loaded these modules from, where its settings come
 * from - and the sending half of its Comms.
 *
 * Names are camelCase and values are plain JSON, because that is what this side
 * of the wire speaks. Python converts once, at the boundary, on its way out.
