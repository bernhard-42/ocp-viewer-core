/**
 * Assembling the three option objects `Viewer.render` and `new Display` take.
 *
 * Which option belongs to which object is three-cad-viewer's fact rather than
 * Python's, so the lists live here in renderer names. The config arrives in
 * those names, Python having converted once at the boundary; no name is
 * translated here. A key still in snake_case is a host that has not converted,
 * and it will miss its entry and fall back to a default rather than be renamed
 * into something plausible.
