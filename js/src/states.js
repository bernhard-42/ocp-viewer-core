 * build123d Studio does today because it never had this logic at all.

 * path - the same form `viewer.treeview.getStates()` returns, which is what
 * makes the two comparable. The renderer assumes those two addressings agree
 * (`node.id === parent.id + "/" + node.name`) and validates it nowhere, so a
 * mismatch here shows up as states that silently fail to restore.
