/**
 * The JavaScript half's own version.
 *
 * The Python half sends its version with every model, and page.js compares
 * the two here: major.minor is the contract and must match, the patch level
 * is each half's own. Kept in step with js/package.json by `make bump-js` -
 * a source constant because the packages ship as plain modules, so there is
 * no build step that could inject it.
