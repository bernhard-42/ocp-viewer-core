 * Reporting viewer changes back to Python.

 * three-cad-viewer calls a notification callback with `{key: {old, new}}` for
 * whatever changed. This turns that into the message a host sends, and keeps a
 * running picture of the viewer's state so a host can answer `status()` out of
 * memory instead of asking the browser.
 *
 * The names here are the renderer's own notification names, which are
 * snake_case - `clip_intersection`, `zebra_count`, `relative_time`. So nothing
 * is translated on the way back: the renderer already emits what Python
 * speaks, and the camelCase conversion is one-directional by the renderer's own
 * choice rather than by ours.

 * Keys that report that something happened, as opposed to what something is.

 * These must never be accumulated into a status snapshot. An accumulated
 * `selectedShapeIDs` replays a selection the user made minutes ago into the
 * next measurement, against a model that may not even contain those ids -
 * build123d Studio hit exactly that and fixed it by sending the delta, and
 * ocp_vscode's standalone still accumulates today.
 *
 * The distinction is not "does it change often". It is whether re-applying the
 * last value to a different model still means anything.
